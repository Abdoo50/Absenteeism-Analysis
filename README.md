## Introduction

Absenteeism in the workplace can have significant impacts on productivity, morale, and overall organizational performance. Understanding the factors contributing to absenteeism can help organizations implement strategies to mitigate its effects. This project employs data analysis techniques to explore absenteeism patterns and potential causal factors.

## Data

The dataset used for this analysis is available [here](https://github.com/Abdoo50/Absenteeism-Analysis). It contains information on various factors such as age, education, transportation, and reasons for absence, among others.

## Analysis

The analysis involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and relationships between different variables. Descriptive statistics, data visualization, and possibly machine learning techniques may be employed to gain insights into absenteeism patterns.

## Results

The findings of the analysis will be summarized here, including any significant trends, correlations, or factors influencing absenteeism rates.
